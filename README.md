# XProfileTagger

A simple chrome extension to tag user profiles based on a key:value pair of usernames and hyperlinks to add context.
Adds a small icon next to the user and a reference link, inline with each matched post.

Todo: generalize plugin to pull configuration + key:value list from specified endpoint.
